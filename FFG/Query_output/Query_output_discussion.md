#### cache - p3
- **ID1 - (2014 - Ho et al.)**
 - res - We consider the resource occupation of the oCMS for 1 core Leon3, as provided in Table II of the corresponding paper of the oCMS. The res increases with the frequency of involvement for processors as inside every oCMS there is a single counter; hence, each task in execution on the processor requires a dedicated oCMS instance.
 - pd, pwd, energy - No data are reported about the initialization time of the oCMS. The oCMS does not introduce overhead at runtime. No data are reported about pwd and energy.
- **ID2 - (2023 - Leon3 statistics unit, L3SU)**
 - res - Since no data are available about the impact on resources of FPGA for the Leon3 statistic unit, we synthesized an L3SU targeting a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA. Results are: 78 lut, 47 ff. INCREASE?

- **ID3 - (2015 - Moro et al.)**
  - res - We consider the resource occupation of the oCMS as 0.3% of the total FPGA area of the SoC, as stated in Section IV.B of the corresponding paper of the oCMS. INCREASE?
  - pd - ...
- **ID4 - (2021 - Valente et al.)**
 - res - We obtain the resource occupation of the oCMS from the comparison between the last row and the first row of Table 6 of the corresponding paper of the oCMS. INCREASE?
 - pd -
- **ID5 - (2016 - Valente et al.)**
 - res - We consider the resource occupation of the oCMS stated in Section IV of the corresponding paper of the oCMS. INCREASE?
 - pd -
- **ID6 - (2023 - AXI PMU)**
  - res - We consider the resource occupation of the oCMS reported by authors of the paper: "G. Valente et al., 2021, A Composable Monitoring System for Heterogeneous Embedded Platforms, ACM Trans. Embed. Comput. Syst.", obtained as comparison between resource occupation of D1a and D0 solution reported in Table 6. INCREASE?
  - pd - INCREASE?
- **ID7 - (2010 - Kyung et al.)**
  - res - We consider the resource occupation of the oCMS stated in Table 3 of the corresponding paper of the oCMS. INCREASE?
  - pd -
- **ID8 - (2022 - Brilli et al.)**
  - res -
  - pd -  We consider the performance degradation of the oCMS reported by authors of the paper: "G. Brilli et al., "Fine-Grained QoS Control via Tightly-Coupled Bandwidth Monitoring and Regulation for FPGA-based Heterogeneous SoCs," 2023 60th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)", in Section IV.a. INCREASE?
- **ID9 - (2023 - Brilli et al.)**
  - res - We contacted the authors to have details about resource occupation as the paper states "less than 1%".  INCREASE?
  - pd -
